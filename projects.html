				<h2>ZtereoBOT</h2>
			</a>
			<p>ZtereoBOT is the coolest (and most cursed) bot you will ever find. ZtereoBOT has an ample selection
				of
				commands that range from moderation commands to fun commands to literally just brain-fart-commands.
				Still a work in progress, so might break down once or twice.</p>

				<h2>WaffleBOT</h2>
			</a>
			<p>WaffleBOT is my excuse to learn Python. It will probably never really have any use but if you still want
				to give it a look feel free to do so. Still going to put in on this website since it's a project
				nevertheless and makes it look like I've done stuff.</p>

		<section class="section ZtereoWEBSITE">
			<a href="https://ztereohype.github.io/ZtereoWEBSITE/" target="_blank" class="link">
				<h2>ZtereoWEBSITE</h2>
			</a>
			<p>ZtereoWEBSITE is the "perfect" website you are on right now. It will mostly be used to advertise my
				completed, current and ongoing projects, but you can also use it to find out how to contact me. This is
				an ongoing project as well, so stay tuned for any brilliant (very) late night updates.</p>

		<section class="section McShaders">
			<h2>Minecraft Shaderpack</h2>
			<p>Although I have no clue about how GLSL even remotely works, I'd love to try and make a very simple/basic OptiFine/shadersmod shaderpack for minecraft, to understand how they work and all.</p>
		</section>

		<section class="section McMod">
			<h2>Minecraft mod</h2>
			<p>Similarly to the shaderpack situation, I have no clue about how a minecraft mod works or even how Java works, but I love that game and have seen what the Fabric community has created and I want to try it!</p>
		</section>
		<section class="section electron">
			<h2>Some sort of web app</h2>
			<p>Either using electron or just simply as a website, I want to try to make some sort of website which is interactive and has both a server side and a client side instead of being a static page like this one.</p>
